Define a function generate_n_chars() that takes an integer n and a character c
and returns a string, n characters long, consisting only of c:s. For example,
generate_n_chars(5,"x") should return the string "xxxxx". (Python is unusual in
that you can actually write an expression 5 * "x" that will evaluate to
"xxxxx". For the sake of the exercise you should ignore that the problem can be
solved in this manner.)
